for some reason the fastboot utility is now included in mac android sdk. so i put the relevant sources together and wrote a simple makefile. 
i tested flashing of recovery on my adp1 and it works just fine.
i did not write any of these files. they all come from android main tree.
i only changed some #include lines to include header files in the same directory.
use it at your own risk
